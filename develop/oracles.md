# ðŸŽ± Oracles

Here are a list of oracles currently integrated into the Taraxa L1 ecosystem.&#x20;



## Stork

Stork is an oracle protocol that enables ultra low latency connections between data providers and both on and off-chain applications. The most common use-case for Stork is pulling and consuming market data in the form of real time price feeds for DeFi.

Here are a few links to get you started with using Stork oracles on Taraxa.&#x20;

* Stork's [developer documentation](https://docs.stork.network/)
* [Stork's contract address](https://docs.stork.network/resources/contract-addresses/evm#taraxa) on Taraxa's mainnet
* How to [consume data](https://docs.stork.network/getting-started/becoming-a-subscriber) on Stork
* List of [asset pair IDs](https://docs.stork.network/resources/asset-id-registry) on the Stork oracle network, the `TARAUSD` is the asset pair ID for $TARA.&#x20;
