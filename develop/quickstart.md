## Building on Taraxa's EVM-compatible Network = super easy

Hi! Thanks for checking out Taraxa's Layer-1 network. Here are a few quick links to get you started right away.&#x20;

* [Create a wallet](../wallet/) using tools you're already familiar with such as Metamask and Ledger
* Get some [testnet tokens from the faucet](https://testnet.explorer.taraxa.io/faucet) on the Taraxa Explorer
* [Connecting to the Taraxa network](connect-to-taraxas-network.md) via our dev deployed RPC endpoint, or running a node of your own&#x20;
* [Deploying a smart contract](smart-contracts/) is super easy, all ETH-compatible tools just work&#x20;
* [Taraxa RPC specifications](taraxa-rpc-specs.md) highlights Taraxa's near-100% compatibility with ETH's RPC specs, with a few minor quirks & exceptions

Let's get building!&#x20;
