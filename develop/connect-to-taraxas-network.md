# Connect to Taraxa's Network

## Connecting to Taraxa's ETH-Compatible Network&#x20;

There are two ways to connect to Taraxa's network,

* Via RPC endpoints&#x20;
* Via mainnet / testnet nodes

Since Taraxa's network is almost 100% ETH-compatible, you can simply follow [Ethereum's JSON-RPC documentation](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#usage-example).&#x20;

The ETH-compatibility with Ethereum also means that almost all tools from the Ethereum ecosystem work with Taraxa. You can use, for example, [Web3.js](https://web3js.org/), [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) and [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to connect to and interact with the Taraxa Network.

There are a few minor exceptions and quirks to Taraxa's ETH-compatibility, you can find them in our [full RPC specification](taraxa-rpc-specifications.md).&#x20;



## Connect via RPC endpoints provided by the dev team&#x20;

You may use the RPC endpoints provided by Taraxa's core development team. Right now these are being provided as is and free of charge, this may change later of course with plenty of notice given to the community.&#x20;

* Mainnet: [https://rpc.mainnet.taraxa.io](https://rpc.mainnet.taraxa.io)
* Testnet: [https://rpc.testnet.taraxa.io/](https://rpc.testnet.taraxa.io/)&#x20;

## Connect via your own Nodes

You may also set up your own nodes on the Mainnet or Testnet. This give you a lot of flexibility in working with your DApp.&#x20;

Here are node setup instructions,&#x20;

* Setting up a [mainnet node](../join-the-mainnet-candidate/mainnet-quick-start.md)&#x20;
* Setting up a [testnet node](../node-setup/testnet\_node\_setup/)&#x20;
