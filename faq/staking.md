# ðŸ’° Staking

Taraxa Staking tl;dr

* Staking TARA means directly delegating your TARA tokens into validator nodes&#x20;
* Staking can be done via the [community site](https://community.taraxa.io/staking\)), or you can do it by directly interacting with the on-chain DPoS contract (tutorial coming soon)
* Staking yields are currently 20% APY, which you will share with the validators (they will take a commission), please note that this is higher than what's stated in the [economics rewards](../tech-whitepaper/economic-model.md#5-5-rewards) section, the dev team is working to build a community voting infrastructure to facilitate community-proposed & voted-on updates to the economics
* You can redeem your yields through the [community site's claim section](https://community.taraxa.io/redeem)

## Stake to Secure the Network!&#x20;

Staking (delegating your TARA to validators) is a critical part of Taraxa's consensus mechanism, which uses proof of stake (PoS) to guard against Sybil attacks. In plain language, staking makes attacking a network expensive, and aims to make attacking a network so expensive that the cost far outstrips the benefits.

When you stake, not only are you helping to secure the network against attacks, you are also earning a yield (rewards) for your efforts.

Please follow the guide below to stake and help secure the Taraxa network!&#x20;

## Staking Guide - Step by Step&#x20;



### >> Register an account on the community site&#x20;

Navigate to the [community site](http://community.taraxa.io/) and register an account.&#x20;

### >> Pass KYC

To claim rewards (e.g., staking commission, yields) from the community site, you must pass KYC. It is in the [profile section](https://community.taraxa.io/profile).&#x20;

> DISCLAIMER: To comply with recent SEC rulings, United States persons and persons from OFAC-sanctioned regions cannot receive token rewards from running nodes. All participants will be required to pass KYC to receive rewards.

### >> Connect your wallet

Connect your wallet (upper-right corner). You may use any web3-enabled wallet that works with the Taraxa network, we recommend MetaMask.&#x20;

### >> Delegate to a validator

Once your wallet is connected, navigate to the [community site's staking page](https://community.taraxa.io/staking) and select one ore more validators to delegate to.&#x20;

On this page you'll see a list of validators that have listed their nodes up for delegation. The "Avalailable for Delegation" shows you how much more delegation this specific node is able to take in. Each node can take on a total of 80 million TARA in delegation, beyond that no more delegation is possible for the specific node.&#x20;

_NOTE: the dev team is working to gather and display past uptime statistics (work in progress) so that you may make an informed choice on which validator to delegate your tokens to. Uptime is critical as it impacts the effective yield rate - i.e., if a node is not turned on, it does not earn any yields._&#x20;

Minimum delegation per validator node is 1000 TARA.&#x20;

### >> Claim staking yields&#x20;

You may claim your staking yields by clicking the "Claim" button next to each of the nodes you've delegated to. You may claim your yields at anytime there are yields available to be claimed.&#x20;

### >> Un-delegate

You may choose to un-delegate your tokens from a validator node at any time, simply select the "Un-delegate" button next to the node.&#x20;

Note that there is an \~30 day delay between when you request an un-delegation and when you actually receive the tokens.&#x20;

There's also a built-in function on the on-chain DPoS contract to switch nodes for your delegation, which only has a 5-block delay (< 20 seconds). This functionality exists but has not yet bee incorporated into the community site's UI, it's coming soon!&#x20;
