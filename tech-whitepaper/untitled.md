The advancement of IoT ecosystems has been consistently held back by technical challenges in security, maintenance, data provenance, and incompatible standards, as well as by business challenges in a generally lacking or lackluster use cases, strategically-risky platform lock-ins, and intentionally-siloed data management, and an increasing social awareness and demand for better privacy protection as devices become ubiquitous. Blockchain technology can help to address many of these challenges by building trust anchors into the ecosystem, thereby granting devices operational and economic independence, an awareness for asset ownership, and the capability to freely trade with one another. In this whitepaper, we introduce Taraxa, a public ledger focused on building trust anchors for IoT ecosystems with the following innovations,

* **Rapidly-finalizing DAG** to maximize throughput and minimize inclusion & finalization latency
* **Fair & efficient proposals** to enable a PoS system to produce fair, efficient, and non-coordinated block proposals   
* **Transaction jurisdiction** to minimize wasted work and maximize network-wide parallel processing 
* **Speculative concurrency** to minimize transaction execution latency
* **Adaptive protocol** to help the network learn and adjust its governing parameters on the fly
* **Trustless light nodes** that can verify what it’s been told by full nodes
