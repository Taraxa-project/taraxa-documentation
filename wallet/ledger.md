## Create a Taraxa wallet on Ledger

Since Taraxa is ETH-compatible, all you need to do is create a regular ETH wallet on Ledger. We'll use this in conjunction with Metamask to get up & running on the Taraxa network!&#x20;

Here are a few guides you should look through,&#x20;

* If you're completely new to Ledger, please check out their [Getting Started](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/sections/4404369606801-Getting-Started?docs=true) guide&#x20;
* Once you get your device set up and running, you'd want to follow [Ledger's guide on how to install the Ethereum app](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009576554-Ethereum-ETH-?support=true) onto your Ledger device, you can follow this official guide from Ledger on how to do&#x20;
* After you have the Ethereum app installed, you should follow [Ledger's guide on adding new accounts to the hardware wallet](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404389482641-Add-your-accounts?docs=true), make sure the accounts are Ethereum accounts&#x20;

Now that you have an Ethereum wallet on your Ledger, let's connect it with Metamask to get it working with the Taraxa network.&#x20;



## Connect Ledger's with Taraxa through Metamask

Because the Taraxa Network is ETH-compatible, the Ethereum App actually works fine with the Taraxa Network, but needs to work through Metamask.&#x20;

Here's how it works, it's pretty simple,&#x20;

* You have an ETH address on your Ledger hardware wallet, if you're new to Ledger you can check out their official [Getting Started](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/sections/4404369606801-Getting-Started?docs=true) guides according to which hardware device you have
* Follow the [How to access your Ledger Ethereum (ETH) account via Metamask](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404366864657-Set-up-and-use-MetaMask-to-access-your-Ledger-Ethereum-ETH-account?docs=true) guide by following Ledger's official documentation&#x20;
* [Add the Taraxa network into Metamask](metamask.md)&#x20;
* Use Metamask to send / receive TARA, and it will be signed by your wallet on the Ledger ETH app

This works because the Taraxa network is compatible with Ethereum's address and cryptography, so when Metamask sends a request for signature for the Taraxa network to the Ledger's ETH app, everything just works.&#x20;
