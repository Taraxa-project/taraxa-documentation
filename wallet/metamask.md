# Metamask

## Metamask's Official Documentation&#x20;

Most ETH-compatible wallets allow you to add a "custom network". As long as that network is ETH-compatible - which Taraxa is - everything just works.&#x20;

[Metamask's official documentation](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-network-RPC#h\_01G63GGJ83DGDRCS2ZWXM37CV5) is quite thorough on how to add a custom network. We highly recommend following their official documentation.&#x20;

You have two options to add Taraxa as a custom network into Metamask.&#x20;

## Option 1: Add Taraxa to Metamask via Chainlist&#x20;

The first way to get add the Taraxa network onto Metamask is via [Chainlist](https://chainlist.wtf/). We highly recommend that you reference [Metamask's Chainlist Documentation](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058992772).&#x20;

Here's a step-by-step guide for adding via Chainlist,&#x20;
