# üëç Participating Exchanges

### What are "Participating Exchanges"?&#x20;

These are the exchanges that the team has had contact with and received confirmation from their official representatives that,&#x20;

1. They will participate in Taraxa's token conversion
2. They have committed to a hard date on which to convert&#x20;

###

### What if I use an exchange that is not on the list?&#x20;

If your preferred exchange is not on the list, it is advised to switch to another exchange that is participating. After the conversion occurs, if your tokens are still on a non-participating exchange, you won't be able to deposit or withdraw your tokens from that exchange.&#x20;

The development team will make its best effort to contact all exchanges currently listing the TARA token, but whether or not they&#x20;
