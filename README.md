# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

## What is Taraxa?

Taraxa is a purpose-built, fast, scalable, and device-friendly Layer-1 public ledger designed to help democratize reputation by making informal data trustworthy.&#x20;

People and devices generate data constantly, but more than 80% of it is informal and cannot be tracked. Examples range from informal verbal agreements, IoT status signals, or casual online discussions. As a result, informal transactional and interactional data remains unstructured, unverifiable, and impossible to trust.

Taraxa tracks informal data and makes it trustworthy with its purpose-built technologies, by decentralizing informal data gathering & analytics and enforcing accountability through signed commitments. With enough informal data, we can build localized reputation networks rooted in communities, enabling even most minor participants to acquire a reputation, becoming more trusted and efficiently rewarded.

## Why build Taraxa?

It is our firm belief that technologies are meant to solve real world problems, and cannot be developed in isolation. The applications we build, will build, and will enable our community to build, will (and do) have concrete functionality implications to how the public ledger infrastructural layer is designed and implemented. To this end, the application and the ledger need to be tightly coupled to create the most optimized outcomes.

This is why we created Taraxa, a purpose-built Layer-1 public ledger to enable us to specifically solve challenges driven by mistrust of informal data.&#x20;
