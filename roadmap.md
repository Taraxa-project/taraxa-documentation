## Rolling 12-Month Roadmap&#x20;

Due to rapid-paced changes, the dev team has transitioned to a rolling roadmap, whereby we periodically update the next 12-month of upcoming development priorities.&#x20;

This roadmap is merely a subset of tasks that the development team is pursuing. The roadmap is a list of confirmed goals that the development team is committed to deliver. What is being constantly discussed and planned is a much larger list of tasks that will be added to the roadmap as their planning becomes clearer.&#x20;
