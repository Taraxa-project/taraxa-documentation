# ðŸ—º Roadmap

## 2023 Priorities

In 2023, Taraxa's priority is driving Adoption for Taraxa's ecosystem. This includes Taraxa's apps, app platforms, and of course Layer-1.&#x20;

Taraxa takes a **product-driven**, **app-first** approach in driving ecosystem adoption. To build a sustainable ecosystem, our Layer-1 must bring highly differentiated use cases instead of copying/pasting what others are doing. Our differentiated use cases focus on leveraging trustworthy social data to help drive automated social campaigns, spot emerging trends, and help everyone build on-chain reputations based on their off-chain social activities. When the use cases receive sufficient traction & attention, the Layer-1 ecosystem can thrive.

See the details of our 2022 Retrospective and Outlook 2023 here.&#x20;

Note, ðŸŽˆ(stretch goal)s are aspirational milestones that may be a stretch for us to achieve, either due to the workload, time constraints, or the unpredictability of working with third-parties.&#x20;



## ðŸ“£ App Adoption&#x20;

* [ ] Launch the Hype app alpha version
* [ ] Run Hype campaigns in the Taraxa community to collect impact data and build our pitch
* [ ] Gain a portfolio of early project adopters for Hype to help rapidly refine the product and build business development credentials
* [ ] Market Hype to a wider audience via publications, influencers, etc.
* [ ] Tie in TARA consumption into Hype as traction builds to drive towards more sustainable economics in the Taraxa ecosystem
* [ ] ðŸŽˆ(stretch goal) Build additional apps as resources allow, e.g., Trend Spotter, and drive adoption in the same manner as Hype



## ðŸš‰ App Platform Adoption

* [ ] Develop & publish APIs & SDKs for the Echo social listening platform, with sample code to help developers build on Echo
* [ ] Release a functional decentralized Echo client so we can begin the process to turn the social listening platform into a decentralized network
* [ ] ðŸŽˆ(stretch goal) Decentralize the Echo social listening platform with sufficiently attractive economics to help drive node operator uptake
* [ ] ðŸŽˆ(stretch goal) Integrate a cross-chain bridge, primarily focused on ETH integration so that Echo on-chain signals could be provided across chains. This is a stretch goal because it depends on other projectsâ€™ timelines that are out of our control



## â›“ Layer-1 Adoption

* [x] Support the ecosystem by refreshing the website to clearly communicate the goals of the project
* [x] Support the community by delivering more stable versions of the explorer
* [ ] Support the community by delivering more stable version of the community site&#x20;
* [x] Support the community by running mock token conversions on the testnet to help the community understand how conversion works
* [ ] Support the community by working with exchanges to complete native token conversion and drive staking & delegation adoption
* [x] Support developers with detailed Layer-1 developer documentation, including how to use common ETH toolchains with Taraxa as it is fully backwards-compatible with ETH
* [ ] Support developers with development quality of life features such as smart contract tracing, newer EVM opcodes, events for on-chain economic contracts, etc.
* [ ] Support node operators with node quality of life features such as light node, fast syncing, improved logging & reporting, etc.
* [ ] Support the community by continuing to improve stability, security, and performance



2023 will be a great year for the Taraxa ecosystem and community!
