## Hype Makes Social Campaigns Fair & Easy&#x20;

Social campaigns are tough.&#x20;

They‚Äôre especially tough in web3, where armies of scammers and bots lay waiting to pounce on every social bounty. Have you ever ran a social campaign, and,&#x20;

* 99% of the rewards went to bots spamming social media instead of your community members?&#x20;
* had an impossible time measuring the impact of your campaigns?&#x20;
* paid a ‚Äúbig-name‚Äù influencer but didn‚Äôt know if their followers were even real?&#x20;

We ran into these problems, constantly. This is why we‚Äôre so excited to introduce Hype, a decentralized application built specifically to make social campaigns easy, with verifiably measurable outcomes, spam blocking, and direct to community rewards that‚Äôs fully automated - built on top of Taraxa‚Äôs revolutionary Layer-1 network.&#x20;

Hype helps a project to reward their community members who hype up and spread awareness for their ecosystem. Anyone in the project‚Äôs ecosystem can set up a Hype Pool, describe what you want hyped up, fund it with rewards and just sit back and watch the magic happen. Hype is powered by a set of decentralized Echo nodes that listens in on over 10k public crypto Telegram groups, automatically capturing relevant conversations to each Hype Pool, and unlocks on-chain rewards from the Pool to participants in the conversations based on their respective impressions. All data and analytics are fully transparent, with every single message fully traceable and auditable directly back to the source inside Telegram.&#x20;

Hype helps community members to hype up their favorite projects, with zero hurdle to participate. All they have to do is do what they‚Äôve always been doing - talk up their project in their favorite crypto Telegram groups. Except now their contributions are being measured and rewarded, as they should be.&#x20;

We believe social campaigns should be fair and easy to do. Rewards should go directly to the community rather than some pay-to-play middleman. This is what a decentralized ecosystem is all about.&#x20;

Join us in reclaiming social!&#x20;



Hype is currently in closed Alpha and will be gradually opened up as the dev team iterates & improves the product. Stay tuned!



## Guide: Participating in a Hype Pool

Participating in a Hype Pool and helping to spread awareness for your favorite projects is dead simple. Here's a step by step guide.&#x20;

### 0.  Submit your crypto Telegram groups

Hype relies on Echo nodes to listen in on public Telegram groups in order to generate the analytics necessary to determine who should be and how much they should be rewarded. Since there is no publicly visible list of all Telegram groups, we need to rely on you to help ensure that as many Telegram groups are indexed as possible, so that crypto enthusiasts and evangelists such as yourself are properly rewarded for your efforts.&#x20;

So before you start participating in a Hype Pool, please [submit the crypto Telegram groups](https://forms.gle/CPbm6Q7ZvaRWg2s97) you that you frequently use to us and we'll ensure they get indexed.&#x20;

Please enter your,&#x20;

* **Email**: if you wish to participate in the bounty (link missing), then please enter the email you've used to register on Taraxa's Community Site. If you don't care about the bounty then just enter any email (or make one up).&#x20;
* **Telegram Groups**: please only enter public, English-speaking, and crypto-related Telegram groups here, with the @ prefix and separated by commas.&#x20;

Thank you for helping to make Hype better!&#x20;



### 1.  Find the Hype Pool you'd like to participate in

Go to the [Hype App](https://gethyped.app/), and on the front page select a Hype Pool you're interested in and click "Learn More".&#x20;

In this example you'll see that there's a Hype Pool set up for Taraxa, or "TARA". A few things to note,&#x20;

* **IMPORTANT: Project Name** and **Token Name**: when participating in the Hype Pool, please make sure your messages in Telegram contains  either the Project Name or the Token Name to be picked up by the algorithm.&#x20;
* **Network** and **Token Name**: note what tokens the rewards are in, and what network it's on.&#x20;
* **Campaign Keyword**: the Hype Pool is about Taraxa the project, but this specific campaign (what the Pool wishes to hype up) is about the mainnet launch. So if you include the keyword "mainnet" in your Telegram messages, it'll be weighted even more.&#x20;
* **Reward / impression**: how much you'll be rewarded per impression, which is an estimate on how many users actually saw your message at the time you typed it. Different Hype Pools will have different impression pricing.&#x20;



### 2.  Start Hyping!&#x20;

Now you're ready to go ahead and start hyping up your favorite project(s)! Just go into a public, English-speaking crypto Telegram group and start talking about the project.&#x20;

Several things to caution,&#x20;

* **Do not spam!** Hype has layers of algorithms specifically designed to catch and filter out spam, if your messages are deemed spam, not only will the messages be filtered out, your Telegram account will also be blacklisted. Spamming also harms the project, making it look like a scam.&#x20;
* **Focus on one project and topic at a time**. Hype is also specifically designed to filter for relevance. If you talk about 10 projects in a huge single message post, that will also be excluded. These messages don't tend to lead to natural conversation and awareness, and aren't helping the project you're trying to hype up.&#x20;
