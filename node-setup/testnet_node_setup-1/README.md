# âš™ Install A Local Node



{% hint style="info" %}
Installing a node takes only a few minutes. _The easiest way to deploy a persistent node that will be "always-on" is using a VPS service in the cloud._
{% endhint %}

## Run a Mainnet or Testnet Node

### Mainnet

Running a mainnet node allows for participation in Taraxa's growing ecosystem either as a [validator](../../become-a-validator/) or as a node for relay, end users and applications.

### Testnet

Running a testnet node helps to ensure the continued improvement of the Taraxa protocol.   By [registering your node on the community site](../proof\_owership.md) you guarantee your node participates in testnet consensus as a validator and has the chance to earn rewards for helping improve Taraxa.
