description: Guide for running the Taraxa Node with Docker on Scaleway
---

# Scaleway

## 1. Register to Scaleway

You can use the following link:

[https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/create-your-scaleway-account/](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/create-your-scaleway-account/)

_NOTE: We will use default project to create Taraxa nodes._

## 2. Create API keys on default project

You can create api keys on this page:

[Scaleway Credentials Page](https://console.scaleway.com/project/credentials)

The document for generating api keys: [https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/generate-api-keys](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/generate-api-keys)

Make a note of that key. We will use it in the next step.

## 3. Creating a Taraxa Node

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you are running this on Windows you will first need to install Windows Subsystem for Linux. You can use [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
{% endhint %}

Then you can download and run the node creation script using this command:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Taraxa-project/taraxa-ops/master/scripts/one-click-Scaleway.sh)"
```

Now you should see a new droplet in your Scaleway account.

_NOTE: It takes a few minutes after the droplet starts to install the Taraxa Node software._

## 4. Connect to your instance

Where is the SSH key?

* If you have added a SSH public key to your default project via Scaleway console page, the script will use it.
*   If you haven't set a public key, the script will generate a new SSH key. You can find the new public key and private key in this directory: `~/.ssh/`.

    ```
    ls -al .ssh/ | grep "taraxa"
    ```

Next, you can login your instance.

## 5. Check the logs

You can use the following commands to check if the node is up and running:

```bash
sudo docker ps

sudo docker logs -f taraxa_compose_node_1
```
