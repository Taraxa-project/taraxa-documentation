# Mac

{% hint style="info" %}
These instructions are specific to Mac. Instructions are also available for [Windows](broken-reference) and [Linux](broken-reference).
{% endhint %}

## 1. Download Docker Desktop

You can download Docker Desktop by accessing [this link for Intel Macs](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/stable/amd64/Docker.dmg) or [this link for Apple chip Macs](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/stable/arm64/Docker.dmg).

![Download Docker Desktop](../../.gitbook/assets/1-download.png)

After the download finishes you can find the dmg file in the `Downloads` directory on the Dock.

![Downloaded Docker Desktop](../../.gitbook/assets/2-downloaded.png)

Open the `Docker.dmg` file.

![Open Docker Desktop](../../.gitbook/assets/3-open.png)

You should see a window similar to the following. Drag and drop the Docker app file into the Applications folder.

![Install Docker Desktop](../../.gitbook/assets/4-install.png)

You may get a notice like this because the app was downloaded from the web and not installed from the App Store. You can safely click "Open" here.

![Confirm Docker Desktop](../../.gitbook/assets/5-allow.png)

Docker also needs some privileges to install the Docker Helper. Click "OK" and enter your password.

![Confirm Docker Desktop](../../.gitbook/assets/6-access.png)

Now you can open Finder and go to the Applications folder. You should see the Docker app.

_NOTE: You can also press `CMD` + `SPACE` and search for Docker_

![Open Docker](../../.gitbook/assets/8-docker.png)

After opening the application you should see a screen similar to this:

![Starting Docker](../../.gitbook/assets/9-starting.png)

When Docker starts you should see this screen. We can close the Docker window now.

![Docker Started](../../.gitbook/assets/10-started.png)

## 2. Open Terminal

We need to use the `Terminal` application in order to start the Taraxa Node image.

You can find the app in the `Utilities` directory under `Applications`.

![Open Utilities](../../.gitbook/assets/11-utilities.png)

Open the terminal application.

_NOTE: You can also press `CMD` + `SPACE` and search for Terminal_

![Open Terminal](../../.gitbook/assets/12-terminal.png)

You should see a window similar to this:

![Terminal Open](../../.gitbook/assets/13-terminal-open.png)

## 3. Start Taraxa

We have to run the following commands one by one:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
curl -L https://github.com/Taraxa-project/taraxa-ops/archive/refs/heads/master.zip > master.zip && unzip master.zip && rm -f master.zip
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
GitHub is blocked in some countries. If you can't run the previous command please refer to the [GitHub is blocked](https://docs.taraxa.io/node-setup/testnet\_node\_setup/github\_blocked) document.
{% endhint %}

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/taraxa-ops-master/taraxa_compose
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f
```

Now Docker is pulling the Taraxa Node image. You should see something similar to this:

![Starting Taraxa](../../.gitbook/assets/14-starting.png)

After it finishes pulling the latest version the node will start and you should see something similar to the following:

![Taraxa Started](../../.gitbook/assets/15-started.png)

\*\*NOTE: \*\*_You can press_ `CTRL` + `C` _to stop displaying the logs_

## 4. Updating the Taraxa Node

From time to time we will release new versions of the node software. Try to keep it up to date using the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/taraxa-ops-master/taraxa_compose
curl -0 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Taraxa-project/taraxa-ops/master/taraxa_compose/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose-new.yml && mv docker-compose-new.yml docker-compose.yml
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
GitHub is blocked in some countries. If you can't run the previous command please refer to the [GitHub is blocked](https://github.com/Taraxa-project/taraxa-documentation/tree/f4ee57d43b23f5ad4a2212fa5ec90254d9181f92/node-setup/testnet\_node\_setup/node-setup/github\_blocked.md) document.
{% endhint %}

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f
```

During the testing period, we will also make changes on the protocol level and you will have to re-sync all the data. Don't worry, we will let you know. To remove the current data and do a full re-sync you have to run the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/taraxa-ops-master/taraxa_compose
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f
```
