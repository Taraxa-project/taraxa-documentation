# ‚ùì Conversion FAQ

## Are there fees involved in the conversion?&#x20;

No, there are no fees involved whatsoever.&#x20;

The conversion uses a one-time mirroring method that does not require any action from the token holder's side. Pleas read the [conversion introduction](introduction.md) to learn more about how the conversion works.&#x20;



## My TARA tokens are in a wallet, do I need to do anything?&#x20;

It's highly likely that you don't need to do anything at all.&#x20;

If your wallet is one that allows you to add and switch between EVM-compatible networks (e.g., [Metamask](../wallet/metamask.md)), then you don't need to do anything. Just add the Taraxa mainnet network according to the [Wallet](https://docs.taraxa.io/wallet) guide and you'll be fine.&#x20;

If your wallet does NOT allow you to connect to other EVM-compatible networks, then you should either move it to another wallet, or export the secret key and import it into a wallet that does support connecting to EVM-compatible networks.&#x20;



## My TARA tokens are in a hardware wallet, do I need to do anything?&#x20;

It's highly likely that you don't need to do anything at all.&#x20;

As long as your hardware wallet is able to support Ethereum wallets (pretty much all of them do), then you can just keep the same addresses, connect them to Metamask (connected to the Taraxa mainnet) and it all works.&#x20;

Read the wallet [guide on Ledger](../wallet/ledger.md) here.&#x20;



## My TARA tokens are staked, do I need to do anything?&#x20;

No, you don't need to do anything.&#x20;

Your staked tokens will be returned to your original staking wallet after the conversion. You'll need to delegate them to a mainnet validator to help secure the network and keep earning staking yields.&#x20;



## My TARA tokens are on an exchange, do I need to do anything?

This depends on which exchange your tokens are on. Please check the [Conversion Status](conversion-status.md) page to see which exchanges have confirmed their support for the exchange.&#x20;

If your exchange is listed with an official announcement of their support for the conversion, then you don't need to do anything.&#x20;

If your exchange is NOT listed or it has not officially confirmed or announced their support, then it's a good idea to move your tokens off that exchange and into your wallet prior to the conversion. This doesn't mean that exchange will not connect to the Taraxa mainnet in the future, it just means there may be disruptions in their deposits and withdrawals of TARA if their support does not happen in time.&#x20;



## I have unclaimed rewards, do I need to do anything?&#x20;

No, you don't need to do anything.&#x20;

All rewards will be mirrored over to Taraxa's Layer-1 during the conversion as well. You will be able to claim any unclaimed rewards via Taraxa's native Layer-1 after the conversion as usual.&#x20;
