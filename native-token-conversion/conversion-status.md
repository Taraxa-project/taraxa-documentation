## Exchanges supporting the conversion

The following exchanges have either publicly supported or is in the process of getting ready to support Taraxa's native token conversion. If your tokens are on an exchange that has not explicitly supported the conversion then it's best to relocate your tokens into your wallet or a supporting exchange, prior to the conversion.&#x20;
