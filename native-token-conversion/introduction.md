## What is the Native Token Conversion?&#x20;

As of this writing, the Taraxa token is still an [ERC-20 contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf001937650bb4f62b57521824b2c20f5b91bea05) residing on the Ethereum blockchain. The goal is to eventually convert the ERC-20 tokens into the native tokens residing on the Taraxa blockchain.



## How the Conversion Works - Technically Speaking

Technically, the conversion is pretty simple: balances on the ERC-20 will be mirrored over to Taraxa's mainnet.&#x20;

The process must be done in coordination with the exchanges that the TARA token is currently listed on, since otherwise all deposits and withdrawals will be disabled on these exchanges.&#x20;

Here's a quick overview of the mechanics of the conversion,&#x20;

1. Coordinate with the exchanges on a specific date & time when the conversion will take place&#x20;
2. Disable the ERC-20 contract on Ethereum
3. Record the exact ETH block where the contract has been disabled, this is the cutoff block height&#x20;
4. Mirror the ERC-20 and staking contract balances at the cutoff block height&#x20;
5. All staked tokens will be returned to the stakers' wallets on Mainnet, a re-delegation process must take place after the conversion
6. 20% of 10bn tokens will be taken from the deployer address into a new Foundation delegation address, which will be delegating to dev-operated nodes on the mainnet - meant to help bootstrap the mainnet (see [section 5.2 of the Whitepaper](https://docs.taraxa.io/tech-whitepaper/economic-model#5.2-token-distribution))
7. A tiny amount of tokens (TBD, maybe \~10 tokens) will be taken from the deployer address into a new faucet address, which will be used to generate minimal transactions traffic on the mainnet - it's not a technical requirement, but a cosmetic one&#x20;
8. New community site will be deployed&#x20;
9. Place these resulting balances inside the genesis block of the Mainnet&#x20;
10. Reset the Mainnet with the updated genesis block&#x20;
11. Deploy updated network statistics endpoints
12. Deploy community site claims contract&#x20;
13. Notify Mainnet validators to reset their nodes to the new version&#x20;
