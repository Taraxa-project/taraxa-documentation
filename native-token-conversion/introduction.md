### What is the Native Token Conversion?&#x20;

As of this writing, the Taraxa token is still an [ERC-20 contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf001937650bb4f62b57521824b2c20f5b91bea05) residing on the Ethereum blockchain. The goal is to eventually convert the ERC-20 tokens into the native tokens residing on the Taraxa blockchain.



### How will the conversion work?&#x20;

Technically, the conversion is pretty simple. But the technical process must be done in coordination with the exchanges that the TARA token is currently listed on, since otherwise all deposits and withdrawals will be disabled on these exchanges.&#x20;

Here's a quick overview of the mechanics of the conversion,&#x20;

1. Coordinate with the exchanges on a specific date & time when the conversion will take place&#x20;
2. Disable the ERC-20 contract on Ethereum&#x20;
3. Mirror the balances of the ERC-20 contract on Ethereum
4. All staked tokens will be returned to the stakers' wallets on Mainnet, a re-delegation process must take place after the conversion&#x20;
5. Place these resulting balances inside the genesis block of the Mainnet&#x20;
6. Reset the Mainnet with the updated genesis block&#x20;

### Where are in the process?&#x20;

We've submitted all materials & documentations required to the exchanges, and are waiting for them to give us a timeframe. You can track the status here.&#x20;
