# ‚öó Mock Conversion \[WIP]

## Prepare for the Conversion!

The native token conversion is a big event for the Taraxa ecosystem. While the [conversion mechanism](https://docs.taraxa.io/native-token-conversion/introduction#how-will-the-conversion-work) is designed to minimize risk and the amount of work end users have to endure, it's nevertheless a good idea to try out the conversion for yourself prior to the actual conversion so you know what to expect.&#x20;

The dev team has put together a mock conversion event to help everyone to experience the conversion before it actually happens - a "mock conversion - by mirroring the ERC-20 balances onto Taraxa's testnet.&#x20;

The latest testnet reset occurred on March 1, 2023 (see [Discord announcement](https://discord.com/channels/419749122556297216/909881217216827402/1080473001138597938)), which mirrored the TARA ERC-20 contract at **`ETH block height: 16720500`**.&#x20;



## Goals of the Mock Conversion&#x20;

There are two simple goals of the mock conversion. Everyone should try to,&#x20;

**ü™ô  Verify your wallet's balance at the stated block height on the testnet, and**&#x20;

**üîê  Verify your wallet's ownership by issuing a few transactions on the testnet**

Let's get into a step by step example.&#x20;



## **ü™ô**  Example 1/2: Verify your Balance&#x20;

### STEP 1: Verify what your balance should be

Alice has a wallet on the ETH network which holds some TARA tokens. She knows that during the native token conversion, all of her TARA holdings will be mirrored onto Taraxa's native Layer-1 network, but she doesn't know exactly how that works. Let's go through step by step on how she can take advantage of this Mock Conversion event to help familiarize herself with the upcoming native token conversion.&#x20;

Alice's wallet address is `0xb2781265b0905123bed40d4d0fb08a4bff28702a` , we can see that by block height `16720500`, Alice has a balance of `1,289,181` TARA ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum network. As of this writing, you can [check this balance](https://etherscan.io/token/0xf001937650bb4f62b57521824b2c20f5b91bea05?a=0xb2781265b0905123bed40d4d0fb08a4bff28702a) yourself on Etherscan, note that the [last transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xafe359ff311b82c34903007635b6319cf94f10a447979709f87e215741248d05) occurred on ETH block `16690828`, which is earlier than the block cutoff of `16720500`.&#x20;

Alice has also participated in staking. As of this writing, she has `86,074,923` TARA tokens staked in the staking contract. If you have staked, you can check this in the [community site's staking section.](https://community.taraxa.io/staking)&#x20;
