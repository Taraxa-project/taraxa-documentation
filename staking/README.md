## How to Stake TARA

There are 3 options available to you when staking TARA, earning staking yields, and helping to secure the Taraxa network all at the same time. Win-win-win.&#x20;

1. Liquid staking: stake via the [liquid staking protocol LARA](https://app.laraprotocol.com/), it's 1-click staking, with the option to auto-compounding your yields back into staking, automatically picks the most reliable & highest-yield validators, and receive a liquid staking token, no KYC, no login required.&#x20;
2. Community site: stake by delegating directly to validators of your choice, through [the community site](staking-via-community-site.md), but it is geo-fenced and requires KYC due to regulatory compliance.&#x20;
3. On-chain: [stake directly on-chain](staking-directly-on-chain.md) by interacting with the on-chain DPoS contract, requires some technical knowledge, works through the Remix app.&#x20;

## Taraxa Staking tl;dr

* Staking TARA means directly delegating your TARA tokens into validator nodes&#x20;
* After the Aspen Upgrade, staking yields are dynamically adjusted. As of this writing it has an APR of \~14-15%, and it will continue to decay over time because Aspen caps the overall supply of TARA. Learn about the [Aspen Upgrade](https://www.taraxa.io/aspen).&#x20;
* Staking yields will be shared between staker and validators (they will take a commission)
* Staking yields , please note that this is higher than what's stated in the [economics rewards](../tech-whitepaper/economic-model.md#5-5-rewards) section, the dev team is working to build a community voting infrastructure to facilitate community-proposed & voted-on updates to the economics
* You can redeem your yields through the [community site's claim section](https://community.taraxa.io/redeem)

## Stake to Secure the Network!&#x20;

Staking (delegating your TARA to validators) is a critical part of Taraxa's consensus mechanism, which uses proof of stake (PoS) to guard against Sybil attacks. In plain language, staking makes attacking a network expensive, and aims to make attacking a network so expensive that the cost far outstrips the benefits.

When you stake, not only are you helping to secure the network against attacks, you are also earning a yield (rewards) for your efforts.

Please follow the guide below to stake and help secure the Taraxa network!&#x20;
