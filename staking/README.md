# ðŸ’° Staking

## Taraxa Staking tl;dr

* Staking TARA means directly delegating your TARA tokens into validator nodes&#x20;
* Staking can be done via either the [community site](staking-via-community-site.md) (requires KYC), or
* Staking can be done [directly on-chain](staking-directly-on-chain.md)
* Staking yields are currently \~20% APY, which you will share with the validators (they will take a commission), please note that this is higher than what's stated in the [economics rewards](../tech-whitepaper/economic-model.md#5-5-rewards) section, the dev team is working to build a community voting infrastructure to facilitate community-proposed & voted-on updates to the economics
* You can redeem your yields through the [community site's claim section](https://community.taraxa.io/redeem)

## Stake to Secure the Network!&#x20;

Staking (delegating your TARA to validators) is a critical part of Taraxa's consensus mechanism, which uses proof of stake (PoS) to guard against Sybil attacks. In plain language, staking makes attacking a network expensive, and aims to make attacking a network so expensive that the cost far outstrips the benefits.

When you stake, not only are you helping to secure the network against attacks, you are also earning a yield (rewards) for your efforts.

Please follow the guide below to stake and help secure the Taraxa network!&#x20;
