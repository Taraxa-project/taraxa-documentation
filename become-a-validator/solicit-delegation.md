# ðŸ“£ Solicit delegation

Each validator node must have a minimum of 500,000 TARA in delegation, otherwise it will not be eligible to participate in consensus. You may delegate this to your own node, or more commonly solicit delegation from the Taraxa community.&#x20;

Here are a few social channels where the Taraxa community congregates, &#x20;

* Taraxa's [Discord server](https://www.taraxa.io/discord)
* Taraxa's [Telegram group](https://www.taraxa.io/tg)
* Taraxa's [official Twitter](https://twitter.com/taraxa\_project)
