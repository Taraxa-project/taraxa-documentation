## Taraxa supports all ETH-compatible wallets

The Taraxa network is backwards-compatible with Ethereum, that means any ETH-compatible wallet that allows you to add a custom, ETH-compatible network will work with Taraxa!&#x20;

As of this writing, the TARA token is still an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network, but we'll soon conduct a native token conversion of all tokens onto Taraxa's native Layer-1 ledger. We'll be sure to keep everyone thoroughly updated throughout.&#x20;

Here are a few examples of wallets supported by Taraxa.&#x20;
